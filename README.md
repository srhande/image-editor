1. PA: Image Editor

3. We had two files: ImageEditor.java and Stack.java
4. Author: Samruddhi Hande
5. I mainly utilized Piazza and the tutors' help to deal with any questions I had about the assignment. For my style and comments, I borrowed from the PA4 method descriptions for wording and clarity purposes.
